### Comparing Cost Burden Across TN Counties for Myocardial Infarction and Selected Cancers

The two most deadly [diseases](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/states/tennessee/tennessee.htm) in Tennessee, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are Heart Disease and Cancer. In this project, we will explore the [Medicare Disparities](https://data.cms.gov/mapping-medicare-disparities) data for acute myocardial infarction (heart attacks) and for colorectal, breast, prostrate, and lung cancers. The medicare disparities datasets for the two conditions above include a one-year total cost of care by county for patients with these conditions.

We will also be using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data for [individual tax returns for 2016](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-return-form-1040-statistics). This data includes the number of returns filed by 7 different income groups, a break down by filing status for the returns filed, and the total income reported for each income group by filing status. We will be calculating the average income reported by county, but you may decide to incorporate other aspects of this data into your analyses if time allows.
